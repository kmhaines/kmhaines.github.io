    <h1>Katrina Marie Haines</h1> <!--Only one h1 per page!-->
        <p>I am a first year MLIS student. In fact, this is my second quarter of my degree!</p>
    <h2 style="margin-bottom: 0px">Where am I?</h2>
        <p style="margin-top: 5px">Goshen County, Wyoming - the south-eastern corner of the state.</p>
    <article> <!--I am not sure if I am using the article and main tags correctly-->
        <h2 style="margin-bottom: 0px;">Why Library and Information Science?</h2>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 5px">A few reasons. First, I have degrees in music and history, both with focus on medieval history and music. This may seem like an odd tangent, but, in fact, the study of history lends itself well to library science. A study of history inherently lends itself to the ideas of preservation of knowledge and access to knowledge, which then leads to libraries, as they have been preservers of knowledge throughout history and are important for access of information. 
        <br>Secondly, I started working in the Goshen County Library in September of 2023 and in doing so, I discovered that I loved it and I did, in fact, want to continue in library work in my future.</p>
    <h3 style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 10px">Academic Interests</h3>
        <ol style="margin-top: 5px">
            <li>My current library science interests are in web content (hence taking this class) and community outreach to disenfranchised groups, specifically LGBTQ+ community members.</li> <!--I started an LGBTQ+ themed book club last quarter! It's a lot of fun! -->
            <li>I am also interested in library history and historical developments. Last quarter, I wrote a paper looking at newspaper articles around the founding of my public library. There was quite the drama over the library board appointments in 1922!</li>

        <h2 style="margin-bottom: 0px;">Hobbies</h2>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 5px">I have numerous hobbies, often caused by autistic interests with my ADHD drive to try to teach myself how to do whatever takes my fancy. <!--adhd and queer audacity to teach myself whatever I want-->
            <br>These include:
            <ul style="margin-top: 0px">
                <li>Sewing - mostly clothing with a specific interest in historical clothing.</li>
                <li>Fiber spinning - both drop spindle spinning and spinning wheel spinning. I mostly spin wool right now.</li>
                <li>Weaving - both tablet/card weaving and rigid heddle loom weaving. This is currently my newest skill as my loom is still stuck in the UK from when I lived there a few years ago.</li>
                <li>Crocheting - I enjoy it but I am terrible at finishing my crocheting projects. I think it took me somewhere around two to three years to finish my pride scarf, and I have an unfinished shawl that I started three years ago.</li>
                <li>Embroidery - I really like embroidery, but it also is very slow to get finished.</li>
                <li>Leatherworking - I've dabbled in this mostly. I made myself a leather breastplate for my halloween costume this year! It was fun but a lot of work.</li>
                <li>Some painting - I've dabbled in watercolor painting and I painted a leather book cover for a book I wanted to rebind for fun (I did this two years ago and have yet to get to the rebinding part)</li>
            </ul>
